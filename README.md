# *Flare Network* price provider

___
**Note:** This is the version for the Flare network. See [`main`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/FTSO-price-provider) branch for the version for the Songbird network.
___

The repository contains an example of *Flare Network* price provider implementation. 

*Flare Networks* encourages data providers to develop their own custom data provider code, mainly due to the competitive nature of price provision in pursuit of Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) rewards.  

## DISCLAIMER

This is an example implementation of a data provider. It uses the library CCXT to obtain prices from certain exchanges. Note that data signal providing for Songbird FTSOs has become a highly competitive business, hence providing the winning prices usually involves more then just sending some prices from exchanges. The software can be freely used subject to the attached license.

## How it works?

A data provider is a process that on one hand collects prices of selected currencies from selected exchanges, and on the other hand, sends those prices to a special contract (`PriceSubmitter`) as a data feed for *Flare Time Series Oracle* (FTSO). Several data providers send their price feeds to the FTSO system, one price per *price epoch* interval (currently set to 3-minute interval), in essence, voting for prices in that epoch. For each price epoch and each currency votes from all data, providers are collected and the "consensus" price is calculated using a weighted median algorithm. Namely, each data provider can have different vote power (weight), which corresponds to the sum of holdings and delegations for WSGB token. In each price epoch, only one (randomly chosen) currency is rewarded. Voters that are close to the median price get rewards in form of SGB tokens.

Voting (=sending a price in price epoch) is done in two steps. The first step is called *submitting* price and this one should be done within the timeframe of the price epoch. Immediately after the price epoch ends, a new price epoch starts. At the same time window for the second step, *revealing* opens. The price epoch (=time to submit) currently lasts 3 minutes, *reveal epoch* (= window timeframe for revealing) currently lasts 1.5 minutes and corresponds to the first half of the next price epoch. The durations of epochs are settable by governance and are available in `FtsoManager`. Each price epoch also has its own, consecutive `epochId`.

Prices are always submitted in USD. Submitting (or sometimes called *committing*) the price requires defining the following values:
- price (an integer where a certain number of least significant digits are considered as decimals, currently set to 5). If the price of an asset is `123.454321` USD, the submitted price should be `12345432`.
- randomly generated large number (in range of `uint256`)

Commit is done in a modified commit-reveal scheme. The hash for commit is calculated as `keccak256(abi.encode(ftsoIndices, prices, randomNumber, addressOfVoter))` where `ftsoIndices` is the list of currency indices. This is done for all currencies at once. Then the contract function `PriceSubmitter.submitHash(epochId, hash)` is called with the calculated `hash`. If `epochId` is incorrect, the call gets reverted.

When price epoch ends, reveal epoch starts and if a voter submitted the price for the just expired price epoch, the voter can reveal price by calling 
`PriceSubmitter.revealPrices(epochId, ftsoIndices, prices, random)` and thus disclose and provide actual prices.
When the reveal epoch ends, all revealed prices are collected and used for the calculation of the weighted median price.
 
### Whitelisting

*Whitelisting* is an automatic and fully decentralized process of selection of data providers with the most vote power. Whitelisting enables data provider's account address to be able to participate in sending prices. If the address from which a data provider sends prices is not whitelisted, all operations for sending prices will revert. The *Flare network* price provider implementation takes care of whitelisting as well, if configured so.

**IMPORTANT**: The term *whitelisting* as used in this document is not to be confused with IP whitelisting of validators nodes to be able to connect to the core network or whitelisting of IP address of a server to access private API nodes or any other IP based whitelisting.

There are two types of data providers, ordinary ones and trusted data providers. Trusted data providers are decided by a governance process and do not need to become whitelisted, as they are whitelisted by default. During usual operations of FTSO system, trusted data providers have exactly the same role as ordinary data providers. Only in exceptional situations when FTSO system goes into a special fallback mode these data providers are relied on to provide prices from which average is calculated. Special fallback mode kicks in if too small number of data providers sends their prices (too small in terms of total vote power), or if price changes abruptly, or if it is triggered by governance. In special fallback mode no rewards are distributed to trusted data providers.

All other providers can try to get whitelisted. Whitelisting is a completely decentralized procedure and it is based purely on vote power. It is managed by `VoterWhitelister` contract. Any data provider with `address` can try to whitelist itself for a currency with `index` by calling `VoterWhitelister.requestWhitelistingVoter(address, index)`. If data provider's vote power (= WFLR balance + WFLR delegations) is high enough, it gets whitelisted. For each currency at most 100 whitelisted data providers can exist. A new data provider can get whitelisted only if there are still free empty slots or its vote power is greater than the voting power of some already whitelisted data provider. In this case, the whitelisted data provider with minimal vote power gets removed from the whitelist. This is fully managed by `VoterWhitelister.requestWhitelistingVoter(...)`. At any time, a data provider can try to obtain its whitelisting mask, by calling `PriceSubmitter.voterWhitelistBitmap(address)`. This is a bitmask, where positions of bits correspond to indices of currencies. An index for a supported currency can be obtained on `FtsoRegistry` contract, by calling `FtsoRegistry.getFtsoIndex(symbol)`. Supported symbols list can be obtained by calling `FtsoRegistry.getSupportedSymbols()`.

### Pricing transactions and priority

If trusted or whitelisted providers are sending correctly formatted submit and/or reveal transactions, they do not get reverted. Furthermore, `PriceSubmitter` is a contract with a special treatment within the network, hence providers pay only 21k gas x 225 Gwei, thus minimal transaction cost for either submit or reveal transaction. The `gasPrice` of a transaction is used for prioritizing transactions in the transaction pool, but not for charging. Since data providing is a very time-critical operation, trusted and whitelisted providers are allowed (and encouraged) to provide comparatively high gas prices to raise the priority of their transactions but are not charged for that. Reveal transactions for more than 10 currencies can burn more than 1M gas in a block, but a valid data provider will not be charged for that. We encourage providers to provide a sufficient gas allowance for commit/reveal calls. Add at least 10% on top of the calculated cost of a transaction, as the submissions contracts are queried relatively often and calculated gas requirements might change in a short (subsecond) time frame.
On the other hand, if a transaction to any call of `PriceSubmitter` contract is reverted, the transaction is charged as usual (burned gas x gasPrice). Note that sending any submit or reveal transaction from a data provider that is neither trusted nor whitelisted for a specific currency will revert. Also note, that whitelisting is done per currency. A data provider can submit and reveal prices only for currencies for which it is whitelisted - otherwise, calls get reverted. 


### Additional information

To learn more about the internal workings of `PriceSubmitter` and `FTSO`-s, we encourage you to check the [kick-off package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/ftso_price_provider_kick_off_package) that goes into more details on whitelisting and submission process or official [smart contract repository](https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts).

## Getting started

- Clone this repository.
- Call `yarn` to install node packages.
- Set up the correct configuration in `configs/config.json` (See *Configuration* below).
- Provide or obtain some vote power to the account from which the data provider will be sending prices. For that SGB coins need to be wrapped to WSGB tokens and either put on the balance of the account or some other account(s) should delegate vote power to that account.
- Run the data provider by calling `./scripts/run-provider.sh ./configs/config.json`

## Configuration

Data provider is configured by a JSON configuration file. In addition, certain parameters can be overridden through environment variable definition in .env file and the private key can be obtained through Google Cloud Secret Manager. The typical configuration looks like this:

```
{
    "accountPrivateKey": <PRIVATE KEY OF YOUR ACCOUNT in 0x... form>,
    "rpcUrl": <RPC URL OF A NETWORK NODE>,
    "priceSubmitterContractAddress": "0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000003",
    "submitOffset": 80000,
    "revealOffset": 2000,
    "whitelist": false,
    "trusted": true,
    "gasPrice": "225000000000",
    "priceProviderList": [
        {
            "symbol": "XRP",
            "decimals": 5,
            "priceProviderClass": "WsLimitedPriceProvider",
            "priceProviderParams": ["XRP/USD", 1.0, [["binanceus","XRP/USD"],["bittrex","XRP/USD"],["kraken","XRP/USD"],["bitstamp","XRP/USD"],["gateio","XRP/USD"]], "first"]
        },
        {
            "symbol": "LTC",
            "decimals": 5,
            "priceProviderClass": "WsLimitedPriceProvider",
            "priceProviderParams": ["LTC/USD", 1.0, [["binanceus","LTC/USD"],["coinbasepro","LTC/USD"],["bitstamp","LTC/USD"],["kraken","LTC/USD"],["bittrex","LTC/USD"]], "first"]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Explanation of parameters in a configuration file

- `accountPrivateKey` - Private key of your account from which prices will be sent. If you use this the private key will be stored on the file system. Make sure to properly secure the server and in case a cloud based virtual machine is used, that the discs are encrypted.
- `rpcUrl` - RPC url of the API node connected to *Songbird Network*.
- `ftsoManagerContractAddress` - Address of the `FtsoManager` contract on the *Flare Network*.
- `submitOffset` - Defines the delay in ms of sending submit calls relative to the start of a price epoch. 
- `revealOffset` - Defines the delay in ms of sending reveal calls relative to the start of reveal period.
- `whitelist` - Defines whether whitelist procedure should be executed at the beginning of the run. Usually should be set to true at least for the first run.
- `trusted` - Defines whether the address of the data provider is trusted. Trusted providers are 
- `gasPrice` - Gas price for transactions sent (submits and reveals). 
- `symbolPrefix` - Prefix for symbols of currencies. Use `test` for testnets and empty string for mainnet.
- `priceProviderList` - A list of price provider data. Each object has the following parameters:
  - `symbol` - FAsset which price will be submitted/revealed (eg. FXRP, FLTC, etc.)
  - `decimals` - Number of decimals (default: 5).
  - `priceProviderClass` - Name of the class as defined in `PriceProviderImpl.ts` (must implement `IPriceProvider` interface).
  - `priceProviderParams` - Array of parameters that are passed to constructor of `priceProviderClass`.

**NOTE:** while prices can be submitted by a smart contract, the voting power of the account is initially 0, even if the account has a large FLR balance. Voting power is obtained by holding wrapped FLRs (Wflr) and/or relevant Fasset tokens. Those can be obtained through `Wflr` contract and relevant Fasset token contracts. See [flare-smart-contracts repo](https://gitlab.com/flarenetwork/flare-smart-contracts) for details.

## IPriceProvider interface and implementations

For custom price collection one can implement its own class obeying `IPriceProvider` interface. This example provides one such implementation 

### `WsLimitedPriceProvider``

We currently use `WsLimitedPriceProvider` class that implements `IPriceProvider` and serves as a provider for prices on *Songbird Network*. Structure of configuration file is the same as described above, so one must set `priceProviderClass` variable to `"WsLimitedPriceProvider"` and `priceProviderParams` to the following list: `[pairName, factor, list of tuples[exchange,pair on that exchange], mode]`.

- `pairName`: just the name of the pair for which we are submitting the price
- `factor`: a number with which we multiply the retrieved price from external exchanges to be then sent to *Flare Networks* (usually is 1.0)
- `list of tuples`: each tuple consists of two values. First is the external exchange name (eg. `bitstamp`, `kraken`, `binanceus`), while the second is the pair name on that exchange (eg. `XRP/USD`, `XRP/USDT`). The list may be arbitrarily long and serves as a list of priorities, that is first we try to retrieve the price from the first tuple in the list, then from the second, etc. Then depending on the last parameter - `mode` - we calculate the price and feed it to *Songbird Network*.
- `mode`: it can either be `first` or `avg`. In the first case it means it returns the price from the first tuple in the list that is possible (if first fails, tries with the second, etc.); in the second case - `avg` - it retrieves prices from all tuples in the list (some may fail and are thus skipped) and then calculates the average of their prices to be fed to *Songbird Network*

Note that this provider is retrieving prices by subscribing to websockets of the exchanges passed in the list of tuples. If no price can be retrieved from websockets, then it fallbacks to retrieving prices via REST API calls - again prioritized by list of tuples.

## Dockerization
-------------

Docker build is started by command: 
```
yarn docker-build
```
which runs script `scripts/docker-build.sh`

In case an error of the following form occurs during the build start:
`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`
docker daemon service should be restarted by
`sudo service docker start`

Docker deploy is issued with command:
`yarn docker-deploy`
which runs the script `scripts/docker-build.sh`

Deployment address is defined by setting SERVER variable in the script.

# Running various commands

One-time calls for wrapping, unwrapping, claiming rewards and setting data provider fee percents.

Must set `RPC_URL` and either `PROJECT_SECRET` or `PRIVATE_KEY` as env variables, and run `yarn tsc` to compile the typescript.

## Wrap

To wrap native currency (SGB, FLR, CFLR) to wrapped instance (WSGB, WFLR, WCFLR) run from root folder: `./scripts/run-command.sh Wrap <amount>` where `<amount>` is in native currency (e.g. 2 for 2 SGB). Also, `<amount>` may be ommited - in this case everything but 100 units are wrapped! 

## Unwrap

To unwrap wrapped currency (WSGB, WFLR, WCFLR) to native instance (SGB, FLR, CFLR) run from root folder: `./scripts/run-command.sh Unwrap <amount>` where `<amount>` is in wrapped currency (e.g. 2 for 2 WSGB). Also, `<amount>` may be ommited - in this case everything is unwrapped!

## ClaimRewards

To claim rewards for certain reward epochs run from root: `./scripts/run-command.sh ClaimRewards <epochs>` where `<epochs>` are rewards epochs separated by comma (e.g. 32,33,34) - this parameter is mandatory.

## SetFee

To set fee percents run from root: `./scripts/run-command.sh SetFee <fee>` where `<fee>` must be a number between 0 and 100 and represents fee percentage (e.g. 100 for 100% fee) - this parameter is mandatory.


# Testnets

The submission process for live net and testnets is the same. The only difference is the configuration file. For testnets (coston2 for flare), you should change the rpc endpoint, private key (for security reasons) and set prefix to `test` (see the full information on config above).

*WARNING:* The configuration file does not include the pricing information for native coin (FLR or C2FLR).
